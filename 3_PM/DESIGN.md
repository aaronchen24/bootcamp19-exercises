Our app will have three primary components: a title/header component at the very top spanning the entire width, a current todo list component on the left half under the header, and an input component on the right half under the header. The input component will have three subcomponents: a submit button, an add todo input box, and a search todo input box. The current todo list will have a subcomponent at the top, and each todo added will be a subcomponent with "edit" and "delete" options for each one. Todos will be stored as objects with a string and a unique identifier. We hope to be able to click and drag the todos around to change the order of the list. Surrounding the current todo list and input component is the state and will pass data to the two components using props. 

As users enter todos into the input bar, they will be stored and rendered in the left component in an unordered list, generating a running list of todos for the user. Then, if the user searches for any preexisting todos, the search todo box will access the data in the current todo list, and the data filters for any matching substrings in that component. In summary: the add bar obtains user input, the current todo list accesses the add bar's info, and the search bar accesses the current todo list info.
